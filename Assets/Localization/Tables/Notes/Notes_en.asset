      Way back up
      in the woods among the evergreens

      There stood a log cabin made of earth
      and wood

      Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode

      Who
      never ever learned to read or write so well

      But he could play a guitar
      just like a-ringin'' a bell'
