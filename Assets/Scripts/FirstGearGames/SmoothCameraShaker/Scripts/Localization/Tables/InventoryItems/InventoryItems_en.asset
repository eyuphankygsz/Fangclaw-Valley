      perfect for igniting my gas lamp. They will guide me through the darkness of
      this cave. Just a single spark, and they will illuminate the mysteries hidden
      within the shadows. Though they may seem ordinary, these matches are crucial

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 49573477128257536
    m_Localized: "The color reminds me of Evelynn\u2019s old red dress. The one that
      once captivated everyone with its elegance... But this flower is more than
      just a memory. When mixed with water, it has the power to restore life. Much
      like Evelynn\u2019s presence once revived my soul."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 49906938020020224
    m_Localized: A flower of subtle resilience. On its own, it grants a modest surge
      of energy, like a brief reprieve in the midst of exhaustion. But when blended
      with tonic water, its potential flourishes, yielding a burst of strength that
      lingers, a testament to its hidden power.

  - m_Id: 49973552979558400
    m_Localized: A drink of both refreshment and remedy. Infused with the bitter
      essence of quinine, tonic water was once a necessary ally in the fight against
      fever. Its effervescence, both invigorating and sharp, has since become a symbol
      of vitality. Mixed with the right elements, it has the power to unlock hidden
      strengths, reviving not just the body, but the spirit as well.
