      As you know, I have a fondness
      for riddles. So here''s one to challenge your wits!


      To unlock the secrets
      behind the door, you must draw inspiration from the wisdom of nature.


      The
      wolf chases the sheep, while the bear remains still.


      Unravel the meaning
      behind this riddle to discover which levers will reveal the path forward.


      Best
      of luck,

      Breakfast: Porridge and a slice of hard

      Lunch: No lunch, you fat pigs!

      Dinner: Baked

      Also, who the fuck dropped
      the little storage''s key to the fucking X!? Now we have to figure out how
      to open X. I think there is some connection with those old useless statues
      around.

      If you find anything useful, mark it on the map near the kitchen.'

    m_Localized: "Alberto had been progressively losing his sanity over the past
      two days. Yet, no one could have ever imagined he would descend into such madness.
      With a sword taken from the Map Room, he brought an untimely end to the life
      of poor Bush. Following this grievous incident, I personally secured the doors
      of the Map Room. We never saw Alberto again.\n\nTo ensure the lengthy password
      was not forgotten, Grimshaw and I devised a small riddle:\n\nFive birds had
      made a wager, They debated how many legs an ant possesses. The first declared
      \u201Cthree,\u201D The third responded \u201Cas many as ours,\u201D The fourth
      stated \u201Cone more than the second,\u201D And the fifth said \u201Ctwo fewer
      than the fourth.\u201D Eventually, they counted, and it turned out the second
      bird was correct.\n\nThus, we succeeded in concealing the password."

      may yield a mysterious result when played in a specific order. I was quite

      We must

      your contributions is crucial for us to solve this mystery.

      The structures I have encountered within
      this cave are far too intricate to be the work of any simple ancient people.
      Whether it is some forgotten civilization or something far more advanced, their
      purpose remains elusive. It is evident that the miners repurposed these chambers,
      yet their original function evades my comprehension.


      We must continue
      our investigation with utmost diligence.
